## Overview

It was so much faster this time! Apparently having an organized plan works better than just letting yourself be carried by the wind! Who knew!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

I started by observing the design and taking notes and sketching out a general plan of action so that I could then work faster without having to refer back to the design file for every little thing. 

I also wrote down a list of the minor things to do (like adding the href for the attribution link), because I usually forget and have to go back to edit after having submitted the solution. 

I focused on the mobile version first, while I usually go from desktop to mobile, and I think it made the styling easier.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to approach tasks in a more organized way and to think about the project more organically, as one entity and not as different parts to be coded separately. Having a clear vision of the whole project from the beginning meant coding from the start with the result in mind, and not having to go back to fix things later on. 

### Continued development

CSS Grids are still a bit confusing to me, that's why if I can I try to use Flex instead. I want to keep practising in the future because I think grids can make responsive designs much easier and better looking.
(Tables, gridsâ€”I think I have issues with anything structured and apollonian...)
